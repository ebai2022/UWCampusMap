# Test a graph that forms a loop through its edges

created graph g

added node n1 to g
added node n2 to g
added node n3 to g
added node n4 to g

added edge 5.000 from n1 to n2 in g
added edge 10.000 from n2 to n3 in g
added edge 5.000 from n3 to n4 in g
added edge 5.000 from n4 to n1 in g

# Path from a node in a cycle to a different node
path from n1 to n4:
n1 to n2 with weight 5.000
n2 to n3 with weight 10.000
n3 to n4 with weight 5.000
total cost: 20.000

# Path from a node in a cycle to itself
path from n1 to n1:
total cost: 0.000
