# Tests the different behavior of list children

created graph g

added node n1 to g
added node n2 to g
added node n3 to g

# No children
the children of n1 in g are:

# One child
added edge 5.000 from n1 to n2 in g
the children of n1 in g are: n2(5.000)

# Multiple edges from same node
added edge 10.000 from n1 to n2 in g
the children of n1 in g are: n2(5.000) n2(10.000)

# Multiple edges from same and different nodes
added edge 3.000 from n1 to n3 in g
the children of n1 in g are: n2(5.000) n2(10.000) n3(3.000)
