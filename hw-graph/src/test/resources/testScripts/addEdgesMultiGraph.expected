# Test edge creation with multiple graphs

# Create graphs
created graph A
created graph B

# Add nodes
added node e1 to A
added node e2 to A
added node e3 to B
added node e4 to B

# Add edges
added edge first from e1 to e2 in A
added edge third from e3 to e4 in B
added edge second from e3 to e4 in B

# Check the edges
the children of e1 in A are: e2(first)
the children of e2 in A are:
the children of e3 in B are: e4(second) e4(third)
the children of e4 in B are:
