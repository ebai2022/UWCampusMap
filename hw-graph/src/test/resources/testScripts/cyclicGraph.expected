# Test a cyclic graph

# Create a graph
created graph A

# Add nodes
added node e1 to A
added node e2 to A

# Add edges
added edge forwards from e1 to e2 in A
added edge backwards from e2 to e1 in A

# Check if the graph is cyclic
the children of e1 in A are: e2(forwards)
the children of e2 in A are: e1(backwards)
