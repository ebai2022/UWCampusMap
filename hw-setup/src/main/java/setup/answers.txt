1. Why did Fibonacci fail the testThrowsIllegalArgumentException< test? What (if anything) did
you have to do to fix it? If you did not have to change anything to fix this issue, explain why.
The test was failing because the program was throwing an exception when the input value was less
than or equal to zero, even though the specification said "nonnegative number". Thus, I just changed
the checking condition to solely less than zero.

2. Why did Fibonacci fail the testBaseCase test? What (if anything) did you have to do to fix
it? If you did not have to change anything to fix this issue, explain why.
It didn't fail the testBaseCase test - if the input was less than two the program automatically
returned 1 which is the correct number for both the 0 and 1 cases.

3.Why did Fibonacci fail the testInductiveCase test? What (if anything) did you have to do to
fix it? If you did not have to change anything to fix this issue, explain why.
I had to change the program to check if the input is less than 2 instead of less than or equal
to 2 because 2 doesn't evaluate to 1. I also had to change the inductive (recursive) calls to
being added to each other because that is how the fibonacci sequence works
