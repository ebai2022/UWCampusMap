Briefly list any changes you made to your graph class during hw-marvel,
and why you made those changes.

I added a containsNode method so that I can check whether or not a node is in the graph. I feel like
this will be something I need in the future so I went ahead and implemented it and created tests for
it (also makes it better for me to test the original graph using junit).
